# Bio

I graduated from The Pennsylvania State University in 1986, after which I had a post-doc appintment at the University of California, Riverside. Since then I worked as a biostatistician and research faculty in the Division of Biostatistics, Yale University School of Medicine (1990-1994), had a visiting appointment in Carnegie Mellon University, Department of Statistics (1995-1996), and have since been a faculty member of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine (Psychiatry and Human Genetics). I have been working in the field of human genetics for the past 23 years and in psychiatric genetics for the past 15 years.


# Specific Research Interests

My research has two major foci: the development or refinement of statistical methods for the analysis of genetic data and the implementation of those methods to discover the genetic basis of disease, especially autism, schizophrenia, and neurodegenerative disorders. My work has been recognized by admission as a fellow to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Statistics Section.
